Since the trained model and dataset are too large, we put all the files into the Zenodo online repository https://zenodo.org/records/12706754?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJpZCI6IjMwNTgyOTYyLTBkNzItNDM1OC05NWViLTE5MWM4NTU0OTIyZSIsImRhdGEiOnt9LCJyYW5kb20iOiJmOWEyZjM4OWZjNDZiZmE0YTkzYzYwMTIwYWNlODE0YiJ9._V-hFw1a1TTNZ0-WlSn9b1SYhbnRDoa_fh8WQDCqomtIS9V3h8tAPe-LLeX5PWoUNbbBakwEkscXHSeidk68hA.

Zenodo has a directory that is the same as the GitHub repository. Move the dataset and model files in the corresponding directory to the corresponding directory of the GitHub repository and execute the directories corresponding to train and test in setup.

We also uploaded the log file printed during the model test, which stores the performance of the model during the test. You can first execute the test command to verify the model performance. If you need to retrain the model, just execute the train command.
